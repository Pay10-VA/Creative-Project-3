# Creative-Project-3

This project is a learning management website for an online class. It is created so that it mocks what a student might see on their end. Here, students can view their and submit assignments, view their grades, and communicate with other classmates via the class group chat. The "assignments" used in this project are mocked data. Some of the assignments are submitted by default to simulate what the website might look like in the middle of a semester.
